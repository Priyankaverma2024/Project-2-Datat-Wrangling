This project is about DATA WRANGLING on pre assign three different types datasets
I  choose GOOGLE COLAB platform to do this project comfotravly.
On google colab first i have to mount my gooale drive .
Then i import numpy and pandas libraries then upload 1st dataset.
After checking datasets shape ,information about datatypes,null values etc
Then I upolad 2nd dataset and merge with the above dataset.
After cleaning of merge dataset I upload 3rd dataset and concatenate with the already merged dataset.
Finally i have got new dataset after concatenation then I clean this new dataset again as previous ones .
Then I import MATPLOTLIB AND SEABORN,SCIPY LIBRARIES for visualzation and to find its central tendency ,skewness of the data, find and remove or trim by mean/median .
Correlation of the dataset also cheked here.  
To understand this Data wrwngling Technique see my Powerpoint presention also .
